Anybody with an interest in teaching children to read can use Blending Sounds\u2122 1 Pro to help students learn basic decoding skills!\n\nPLEASE NOTE:\n- Requires iPad 2 or higher\n- This app is Australian! US and UK accents coming in the next update\n- Blending Sounds\u2122 1 Pro is not just a game - it is a powerful and fully customisable teaching tool. Please take some time to experiment with it yourself before trying it with students  \n\nWhy is the ability to blend (join) speech sounds when reading so important?\n\nSkilled readers are good at understanding that words are made up of speech sounds (a skill called phonemic awareness) and they are also good at understanding how these speech sounds are represented by letters. This knowledge helps children to \u2018decode\u2019 unfamiliar words by blending (joining) the speech sounds to recognise the word. Difficulties with these skills are a hallmark of the struggling reader. Furthermore, teaching methods that begin by teaching students letter-sound relationships (called \u2018synthetic phonics\u2019 methods) have been shown through research to be more effective than other approaches in teaching reading, regardless of whether students do or do not have reading difficulties. The evidence from the past several decades of reading research is clear: using letter-sound knowledge to decode unfamiliar words is crucial in learning to read, since it helps students to teach themselves new words. \n\nHow does Blending Sounds\u2122 1 Pro help?\n \nBlending Sounds\u2122 1 Pro uses a patent pending, self-adjusting, multisensory teaching method to help teach beginning and struggling readers to use letter-sound knowledge to decode and recognise simple words with direct letter-sound patterns, such as "cat, stop" and "lost". The teaching system automatically identifies what a child knows, what the child does not know, and which words the child confuses. The app includes a large library of CVC, CCVC and CVCC words and is fully customisable, making it easy to set up custom activities to teach students to read specific word types (such as words ending in -at, or words beginning with st-). \n\nWho should use Blending Sounds\u2122 1 Pro?\n\nBlending Sounds\u2122 1 Pro is ideal for helping beginning readers, students with reading difficulties and students learning English as a second language. It is a perfect complement to any phonics program and is fully customisable. We are confident it will quickly become a favourite tool for teachers, parents, reading difficulty specialists and anybody else with an interest in the teaching of reading and spelling! \n\nFeatures\n- Created by a speech-language pathologist specialising in reading development\n- Scientifically-based\n- Easy to use\n- Fun, intuitive and powerful teaching tool\n- Perfect for children of all ages learning to read English, including students with learning difficulties and students of English as a second language (ESL)\n- Patent-pending, adjustable memory-aid system helps students remember letter-sound patterns\n- Create and save custom activities to complement any synthetic phonics approach'

In the Spin and Spell app, players spin letters on a dial to complete a two- or three-letter word. Early readers distinguish between beginning, middle and ending word sounds and letters. Spin and Spell offers three levels of activities.\n \nBob Books Spin and Spell is designed to introduce early readers to word families, and make spelling easier and more intuitive through connecting words and sounds. Repetition, picture-word association, and focusing on specific parts of the word all contribute to giving new spellers tools for success.\n \nFEATURES \nPlayers spin the dial to complete a word, focusing on either the beginning, ending or middle sound.

This enables them to understand new words individually and read more confidently.\n\nInitially, let\u2019s explain what Phonics is.\nPhonics is a reading technique in which youngsters first understand the sounds (or phonemes) that one or more letters make together when read out loud, and after that start to put those sounds together into words then sentences. The concept behind learning phonics is the fact that children learn how to read by building a knowledge of how these sounds are connected with individual letters, groups of letters, and lastly complete words. Learning to read with phonics can be hugely effective, particularly if your child learns to read from a young age.\n\nWe consistently create fun games for kids, teenagers and adults, simply check out our website: https://www.ppppstudio.com"

A Word Thief is loose in the town stealing all the words and letters. This is your chance to help out and earn your detective\u2019s badge. Find all the hidden words before the Word Thief steals them and become a spelling detective. A fast paced spelling game with a cute but relentless Word Thief!\n\nKids, this is how it works:\nYou navigate through the town on your quest to find the hidden words. If you manage to find all of them before the Word Thief has a chance to steal the ones you have found, you will go on to the detective\u2019s challenge. If the Word Thief beats you to it, you will have to recover the stolen words by spelling them.\n\nEither way it goes, it will be a lot of fun learning. Whether you reach the detective\u2019s challenge or you have to practice your spelling a little more, you will earn points toward your detective\u2019s batch. After each round you will be returned to the town menu ready to find more hidden words.\n\nParents, this is what you might want to know:\nThe game has built-in \u201cforking logic\u201d meaning that if your child passes the initial word finding challenge he or she will move on to the more tricky and fun detective\u2019s challenge. If your child does not find all the hidden words before the cute Word Thief steals them, he or she will go on to recover the stolen words by spelling them on screen using letter tiles.\n\nThus, every round consists of two parts; word finding AND detective\u2019s challenge OR word recovery. The game has 24 rounds but game play within each round is randomly generated which creates a unique game experience every time.\n\nThe game has three difficulty settings challenging kids aged 5 to 9. Happi & The Word Thief also has built in support for the following languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Swedish, Danish and Norwegian. The language can be changed inside the app making it easy to switch back an forth for bilingual children or parents wanting their child to start learning a second language. \n\nKNOW WHAT\'S INSIDE \nAs a MOMs with Apps member, we follow the "Know what\'s inside" best practices for kids\u2019 apps.'

Happi Words is a vocabulary, spelling and association game for 6-9 year-olds that stimulates lateral thinking and sharpens your creative problem solving skills. It also promotes academic risk taking with its built-in multilevel hint system that encourages players to try their own solution before asking for help.\n\n- The game has been featured multiple times in App Stores all over the world and \n- Has been recommended for the special needs community by A4cwsn.com who says that it is "A really fun and educational word association game for kids that will help improve picture/word association, spelling and vocabulary, highly recommended"\n\nHappi Words is the 7th learning game from the award winning Happi series. In this game kids (and parents) will try to figure out and spell the word that connects three pictures. When you do, you are rewarded with stars that buys really cool and funny collectors cards. Every level has lifelines to help you along if you get stuck. Try not to use them unless you really have to as solving a level on your own will give you the option to save your earned stars for later so that you can afford the hard to get cards at the top of the deck.\n\nHappi Words has been meticulously crafted to be: \n\u2022 Hard to put down (you will want to win all the cards, we promise) \n\u2022 Educational (you will have to use both your logic and spelling skills) \n\u2022 Strategic (should I get this card now or save up for a more expensive one) \n\u2022 Clever (every card has a funny name and status message) \n\u2022 Beautiful (just look at the screen shots\u2026:-)\n\u2022 Passed around as it gives you the option to create different user profiles\n\n Special note to parents: All collectors cards have a name and a short status message which have been purposefully designed to, on occasion, spur questions from your child. We have done so because we believe in involving the parent in the gaming experience. You should expect to hear questions like: What does this mean, how is this funny, why did they call him that\u2026'

Anybody with an interest in teaching children to read can use Letter Sounds\u2122 1 Pro to help children learn common letter-sound relationships!\n\nLetter Sounds\u2122 1 Pro is based on our flagship program, ReadingSounds\xae 1 Pro, which is used in over 1000 Australian schools and is being described by educators as a breakthrough in teaching children how to read.\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE:\n- Requires iPad 2 or higher\n- Includes US, UK and Australian accents! To switch accents, tap 'settings' from the Main Menu.\n- Although children love using it, Letter Sounds\u2122 1 Pro is not just a game - it is a powerful and fully customisable teaching tool. Please take some time to experiment with it yourself before trying it with students!  \n\n\nWhy is letter-sound knowledge so important?\n\nThe past several decades of research have provided conclusive evidence that children who are strong readers are skilled in using letter-sound knowledge to learn new words when reading. Skilled readers are good at understanding that words are made up of speech sounds (a skill called phonemic awareness) and they are also good at understanding how these speech sounds are represented by letters. This knowledge helps children to \u2018decode\u2019 written language and teach themselves new words. Difficulties with these skills are hallmarks of the struggling reader. Furthermore, teaching methods that begin by teaching students letter-sound relationships (called \u2018synthetic phonics\u2019 methods) have been shown through research to be more effective than other approaches in teaching reading, regardless of whether students do or do not have reading difficulties. The evidence is clear: letter-sound knowledge is crucial in learning to read and spell since it helps students to teach themselves new words. \n\n\nHow does Letter Sounds\u2122 1 Pro help?\n \nUnderstanding that letters typically represent certain speech sounds poses a challenge to beginning readers since there is no meaningful relationship between the way that letters look and the speech sounds they typically represent. For example, there is no reason why the squiggle \u201cs\u201d represents the sound /s/ as in \u201csun\u201d. Children must also learn to distinguish between similar letters and sounds (e.g. \u201cb\u201d vs \u201cd\u201d) when learning letter-sound patterns.  \n\nChildren are taught meaningful associations between the way that letters look and the speech sounds they typically represent through a unique system of visual, auditory and articulatory (speech sound) memory aids, or mnemonics. The teaching system in the app automatically identifies what a child knows, what the child does not know, and which letter-sound patterns the child confuses. Letter Sounds\u2122 1 Pro teaches children to discriminate between confusing patterns, and strengthens weaknesses in letter-sound understanding. \n\n\nWho should use Letter Sounds\u2122 1 Pro?\n\nLetter Sounds\u2122 1 Pro is ideal for helping beginning readers, students with reading difficulties and students learning English as a second language. It is a perfect complement to any phonics program and is fully customisable, making it easy to set up custom activities to teach students specific letter-sound patterns. We are confident it will quickly become a favourite tool for teachers, parents, reading specialists and anybody else with an interest in the teaching of reading and spelling!"

However, learning the links between letter patterns and speech sounds is not easy! LetterSounds\u2122 2 Pro provides a unique, fun and highly engaging way for students of all ages to learn the relationships between groups of letters and speech sounds for reading and spelling! \n\nThe app uses a patent pending, highly effective, multisensory teaching method which is being described by educators as a breakthrough in teaching students to read. This method makes it easy to teach students to rapidly, automatically and accurately recognise the most common letter-sound patterns in English. \n\nLetterSounds\u2122 2 Pro was developed by Dr. Bartek Rajkowski, PhD, a speech-language pathologist specialising in reading development. The program is based on research into the underlying mechanisms of reading acquisition and thousands of hours of clinical experience in teaching students how to read.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:\n- Requires iPad 2 or higher\n- This app is Australian!

Please take some time to experiment with it yourself before trying it with students! \n\nWhy is learning the links between speech sounds and the letter patterns that typically represent them so important? \n\nThe past several decades of research have provided conclusive evidence that competent readers are skilled in using letter-sound knowledge to work out (decode) unfamiliar words when reading. Difficulty in understanding that words are made up of sounds (a skill called phonemic awareness) and just how speech sounds are represented by letters are hallmarks of the struggling reader. Furthermore, teaching methods that begin by teaching students letter-sound relationships (synthetic phonics methods) are known to be superior to other approaches in teaching reading, regardless of whether students do or do not have reading difficulties. \n\nUnderstanding that letters typically represent certain speech sounds poses a challenge to students learning to read since there is no meaningful relationship between the way that letters and letter patterns look and the speech sounds they typically represent. For example, there is no reason why the letter pattern \u201cigh\u201d represents the speech sound in the middle of the word \u201cnight\u201d. \n\nLetterSounds\u2122 2 Pro makes learning (and teaching) these relationships easy through its unique game-based teaching method! \n\nSummary of Features\n\n- Created by a reading specialist\n- Scientifically-based\n- Easy to use\n- Fun, intuitive and powerful teaching tool\n- Includes 64 consonant, vowel, r-controlled and common suffix letter patterns and their corresponding speech sounds / articulations\n- Patent-pending, adjustable memory-aid system helps students remember letter-sound patterns\n- Create and save custom letter-sound pattern sets to complement any synthetic phonics approach!\n- Includes preset letter-sound tile sets for popular synthetic phonics programs Jolly Phonics and MULTILIT\n- Perfect for beginning readers, older students with reading difficulties or students of English as a second language (ESL)\n\nAlthough designed to be used independently, LetterSounds\u2122 2 Pro is a perfect complement to LetterSounds\u2122 1 Pro, which helps students to learn basic (single letter) letter-sound links. \n\nWhether you are a teacher, parent or reading specialist, we are confident that  LetterSounds\u2122 2 Pro will become a favourite teaching tool!'

For this there exist so-called spelling alphabets.\n\nA spelling alphabet, radio alphabet, or telephone alphabet is a set of words which are used to stand for the letters of an alphabet. Each word in the spelling alphabet typically replaces the name of the letter with which it starts. It is used to spell out words when speaking to someone not able to see the speaker, meaning there are no visual cues which assist the listener.\n\nThe word Xija for example, based on the English Spelling alphabet is spelled X-ray Isaac Jack Alfred.\n\nSpelling alphabets are especially useful when speaking in a noisy environment when clarity and promptness of communication is essential, for example during two-way radio communication between an aircraft pilot and air traffic control, or in military operations. Whereas the names of many letters sound alike, the set of replacement words can be selected to be as distinct from each other as possible, to minimise the likelihood of ambiguity or mistaking one letter for another.\n\n\n\nReSpell+ Features:\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++  \n\nAvailable Spelling / Phonetic Alphabets in ReSpell \n(* denotes voice output support)\n\n* American Radio Relay League (ARRL)\n* British Navy / JAN, English\n* Czech - \u010ce\u0161tina\n* Dutch, Nederlands\n* English (*)\n* English pronunciation (*)\n* European, English (Europe)\n* Finnish, suomi (Finland)\n* French, Fran\xe7ais (France)\n* German (Austria - \xd6sterreich \xd6NORM A 1081) (*)\n* German (Germany - Deutschland DIN 5009) (*)\n* German pronunciation (Germany - Deutsche Lautsprache) (*)\n* German (Switzerland - Schweiz) (*)\n* ITU / ICAO / NATO (*)\n* International\n* Italian, Italiano (Italy)\n* Japanese, Nihongo (Japan)\n* Joint US Army / Navy, English\n* Swedish, Svenska (Sweden)\n\n\n\n+ After you enter a word or a text, for example a name, ReSpell displays all codewords to spell it.

Sight Words 1 : Common English Words | 1.4 | 2017-09-12T12:52:54Z | Reading Doctor Pty Ltd | £15.99 |2014-04-03T21:46:43Z | ['Education', 'Games', 'Word'] |"Sight Words 1 Pro helps you teach students who are learning to read and spell to automatically recognise and understand the 200 most common words in English.\n\nSight Words 1 Pro uses a unique, highly effective teaching method to improve word recognition, reading fluency and vocabulary knowledge. It was developed by Dr. Bartek Rajkowski, PhD, a speech-language pathologist specialising in reading difficulties. \n\nPLEASE NOTE:\n- Requires iPad 2 or higher\n- Although students love using it, Sight Words 1 Pro is not just a game - it is a powerful and fully customisable teaching tool. Please take some time to experiment with it yourself before trying it with students!\n\nThe past several decades of research have provided conclusive evidence that competent readers are skilled in using letter-sound knowledge to work out (decode) unfamiliar words when reading. Teaching methods that begin by teaching students letter-sound relationships (synthetic phonics methods) are known to be superior to other approaches in teaching reading, regardless of whether students do or do not have reading difficulties. Decoding skills are crucial for self-teaching, as they may be used to work out regular words (words with regular sound-spelling patterns, such as \u2018stop\u2019 and \u2018flight\u2019) however they are not as useful for learning the approximately 20% of English words with irregular spellings (words such as \u2018who\u2019 and \u2018said\u2019). \n\nResearch suggests that in addition to being taught to decode, students should be explicitly taught to recognise common words, especially those with irregular spellings. Learning to instantly recognise  highly frequent words helps students to develop fluency in reading. Sight Words 1 Pro uses a patent pending, self-adjusting, multisensory teaching method to teach beginning and struggling readers to rapidly, automatically and accurately recognise the most common sight words in English. \n\nWhether you are a teacher, parent or reading specialist, we are confident that Sight Words 1 Pro will quickly become a favourite teaching tool. For more information about the program, please see www.readingdoctor.com.au. \n\nPlease note: teaching students sight words before they have learnt basic decoding skills is NOT recommended, and not supported by research! Teaching sight words should be a complementary strategy to assist the development of fluency as part of a systematic, phonics based method of reading instruction. \n\nIf you have any questions or need help, please don't hesitate to contact us!"

It is a fun, effective and scientifically based teaching tool that helps you to teach students to segment (break up) words into speech sounds and to then spell them using letter-sound knowledge. The app uses a unique teaching system that automatically identifies what a child knows, what the child does not know, and which words the student finds difficult.\n\nSpelling Sounds\u2122 1 Pro includes a large library of CVC (e.g. 'cat'), CCVC (e.g. 'stop') and CVCC (e.g. 'lost') words and is fully customisable, making it easy to set up custom activities to teach students to read specific word types (such as three letter words ending in -at, or four letter words beginning with st-).\n\nSpelling Sounds\u2122 1 Pro is ideal for helping beginning spellers, students with spelling difficulties and students learning English as a second language. It is a perfect complement to any phonics program and is sure to become a favourite tool for teachers, parents, literacy specialists and anybody else with an interest in the teaching of reading and spelling! \n\nPLEASE NOTE:\n\n- Requires iPad 2 or higher\n- This app is Australian! US and UK accents coming soon\n- Spelling Sounds\u2122 1 Pro is not just a game - it is a powerful and fully customisable teaching tool. Please take some time to experiment with it yourself before trying it with students!\n\nWHY IS THE ABILITY TO BREAK WORDS UP INTO SPEECH SOUNDS WHEN SPELLING IMPORTANT?\n\nSkilled spellers are good at understanding that words are made up of speech sounds (a skill called phonemic awareness). They are also good at understanding how these speech sounds are represented by letters in words. These skills help children to spell words successfully because understanding how letters usually represent the way we say words gives children an advantage in understanding our spelling system. Difficulties with these skills are a hallmark of the struggling speller.\n\nSUMMARY OF FEATURES\n\n- Teaches students basic spelling and segmentation skills \n- Includes a huge library of CVC, CCVC & CVCC words, pictures and sentences\n- Developed by a reading specialist\n- Fun, effective, scientifically based  \n- Multisensory, scaffolded support to assist learning\n- Unique, patent pending, highly effective teaching method\n- Complements any phonics program\n- Fully customisable: create activities with specific word patterns!"

While developing Spelltronaut we followed the government guidance on English programmes of study (KS1 & KS2) national curriculum spelling words and have included all statutory, non-statutory words and more. We use a proven method to help kids learn spelling similar to school and the home learning activity: look, say, cover, write and check.

The programme follows weekly spelling lists grouped in coloured rows for each term. The only thing kids need to do is to choose weekly spelling same as school learning and study at home freely and whenever they choose. After selecting weekly spelling kids will see the list of words and have time to study and learn the words before starting their weekly spelling test. Enabling tips will show an example sentence to help spelling if you are learning homophones or near homophones. It is possible to listen to the English words again if you struggle to hear them at first. Type words and click check to see if the English words are correct. If misspelt kids will see the correct spelling. At the end of the spelling test, kids will be able to see their score, their mistakes and learn from them. Study more to achieve better scores.\n\nSpelltronaut : Primary Spelling provides every kid with a home learning tool to help them study and get 10/10 every spelling test.

The 3D models are presented as balloon-shaped animals and the game has 5 levels to complete. Sploony is free to try with five complementary characters and for a small fee, all additional 40+ characters can be unlocked.\n\nDid we mention that Sploony is multi-lingual and all characters can be translated to the four main languages? \n- English\n- Italian\n- Spanish\n- French\n\nHow does it work?\nThe five Animal Zoo categories are organized from the easiest to more complicated, starting with the difficulty level of the equivalent of English first-graders. After selecting a category, the game will display the animal-shaped balloon, together with randomly scattered 3D letters within the game environment. The player has to find these letters by moving the device in any direction of the XYZ axes. Tapping on the letter in the correct order will produce a celebration effect and if the letter wasn\'t expected, it will burn up. Incorrectly spelled words will be stored for the player in a separate category called "My Mishaps", where they all can be revisited and corrected. Even adults have fun with this way of learning.\n\nNo sign-up is required and the in-app purchase will be charged to your iTunes account. There is no expiry date on the purchase as it is a one-off payment which will unlock the Animal Zoo Pack. We will be adding more categories and languages in the future so stay tuned. It is designed for both iPhone and iPad. If you want to use the game on both devices simultaneously, because there isn\'t any account to log on, please consider making the purchase on one device and on the second device navigate to game settings, select "Restore Purchases" and sign in with the same Apple ID you used to purchase the pack on the first device. After checking with App Store it will be synchronized and unlocked.\n\nHappy learning!\n\nCredits:\nUI Design by Laura Tverdota.\nAll 3D characters were created by Susanne Meerwald-Stadler'

Writing Therapy also has a built-in cueing hierarchy to give "hints" on each level, making the exercise one step easier to allow success on each trial. A virtual set of letter tiles makes therapy go faster with more repetitions in less time. \n\nYou can add your own words and pictures to create completely customised spelling lists! Learn to spell names, places, or words related to each user\'s needs. \n\nThis app features clear photographs, iconic graphics, and a clear male voice in 5 languages. Users will benefit from the trial-and-error format and self-selected cues for learning these common words with graduated activities that will grow with them as they develop or improve. \n\nSettings allow limiting the length of the words, selecting capital or lowercase letters, designating which of 12 categories are presented, and choosing how letters are selected. For users with difficulty dragging, an alternative tapping access method is available. Speech-Language Therapists, family members, and teachers can recommend the appropriate modes and levels for each user and receive e-mailed reports of results (ready for professional progress notes). \n\nWriting Therapy is another powerful app in Tactus Therapy Solutions\' professionally-designed Language Therapy suite of speech-language therapy apps. It is the perfect companion to Comprehension Therapy, Naming Therapy, and Reading Therapy. \n\nOur customers love this app! Read what they have to say: \n\n"I really like that this app can be used by both children and adults. I love the great real-life photographs used instead of cartoon pictures or line drawings. The functional, categorized vocabulary you use in your apps is appreciated!! I especially like the feature allowing older students/clients the opportunity to analyze their responses prior to submitted them. This app has great control over the length of the words selected, the voice quality is good, and clinicians will appreciate the data reporting! Great job!" \n\n"Great app, highly engaging! I used this app with two of my aphasia clients- one in her 30s and one in his 50s. Both found it engaging and wanted to continue to use the app throughout their session. I like the different levels of difficulty and the hints (which both of my clients appreciated as well). Great app!" \n\n"Beautifully done! A child or an adult can use this; the very nice part is that it isn\'t childish as many learn to spell apps are, which I absolutely love. My favorite part is the fact that words can actually be misspelled which allows the user to decide for themselves if it is correct or not BEFORE hitting the check button. So the target word is actually learned rather than just swiping letters until they all go into the correct slot. Love this app!"'

It starts with matching letters, which is rewarded with sound and animation when each animal's name is spelled, and progresses to harder levels.  In level 2, there are no vowels shown for hints, in level 3, no consonants, and by level 4, the player should know the whole word and where the letters go.\n\nAnimal sounds, congratulatory music, and stars track progress.  After completing all 4 levels (8 words per level), a Certificate of Excellence in Spelling is presented, can be customized with draggable stickers and saved to the Camera Roll for printing and sharing.\n\nMany elements have touch interactions, such as birds, moon, sun, and animals, where touch creates new animation, sound, or movement.  A fun, age-appropriate app for learning the alphabet and beginning to spell."
